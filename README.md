To build and run this system, follow these steps: (in the future there will be a build file)
1. Extract all files in the folder.
2. Navigate in a terminal to the main project directory.  This should be CSCI352-PROJECT directory.
3. Use the MySQL script(s) in /database to create your own instance of the infirmassist database.  MAKE SURE TO START WITH "infirmassist_patient.sql"!!! It is important to create the connection with the name infirmassist.  You will most likely need to use MySQL workbench for this.  Make sure that the database connection is hosted on localhost (127.0.0.1) and is hosted on port 3306.  The last thing you will need to do is open up the server/server.js file, and where the connection is created (I have comments where you need to go) and you will need to change the information to your password and any other differences you have.
4. After this is done, go back to the terminal where you are in the CSCI352-PROJECT directory.  Make sure you have NodeJS installed.  If so, attempt to run "npm run build".  If this command does not work, run "npm install vite".  Once the install is done try again.  If this still does not work, make sure to install any dependency that the program is throwing an error to (this can also be in CSCI352/server).  Once it successfully compiles, you will see a "dist" folder appear and will not get any error messages. 
5. Now, you should be able to run "node server/server.js" and the website should begin running.
